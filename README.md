# Youtube Reaction Removing

Google doesn't allow you to just remove your past when it comes to micro-interactions. So it offers only a view where there's a chunk of them with delete buttons, if I remember correctly! Anyway, this script did the job for me, yet barely, since they implement some automation detection mechanisms it seems, or it simply throughput limitations, I'm not sure, nor that I care anymore; the nightmare is over, alhamdu-li-llah!

If you're going to build off of this, keep testing it on a single list of items -showing before the infinite loading mechanism- and reload the page, to ensure that they were actually deleted.
